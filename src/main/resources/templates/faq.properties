When you create your account, you must first add your clothing to our database.\u000dAfter that, you can use our AI to generate you outfits!\u000dThe more clothing you add, the more choices the AI has to go through, giving you a lot more outfit choices.\u000d No longer have that piece of clothing? No problem! Just simply remove it on the website, and we will stop recommending it.
