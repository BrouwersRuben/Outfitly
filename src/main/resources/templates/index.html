                        A subscription based application that, with the help of Artificial Intelligence, would assist
                        the user with the daily task of picking out clothes for the day by taking into account the
                        weather forecast as well as the clothing inventory of the user.

                        Besides that the application would also serve a secondary purpose as a clothing manager,
                        where the user would be able to see which clothes need to be washed, which clothes are currently
                        washing and which clothes are available for selection.
