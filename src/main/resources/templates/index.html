                        Our mission is to help people make correct decisions when it comes to picking their clothing and
                        even automating this process for them. The main goal is to save our customersâ€™ time, so they can
                        focus on more important tasks.

                        a subscription based application that, with the help of Artificial Intelligence, would assist
                        the user with the daily task of picking out clothes for the day by taking into account the
                        weather forecast as well as the clothing inventory of the user.

                        Besides that the application would also serve a secondary purpose as a clothing manager,
                        where the user would be able to see which clothes need to be washed, which clothes are currently
                        washing and which clothes are available for selection.
