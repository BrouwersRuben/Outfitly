                        Our mission is to help people make correct decisions when it comes to picking their clothing and
                        even automating this process for them. The main goal is to save our customersâ€™ time, so they can
                        focus on more important tasks.

                        A subscription based application that, with the help of Artificial Intelligence, would assist
                        the user with the daily task of picking out clothes for the day by taking into account the
                        weather forecast as well as the clothing inventory of the user.

                        Besides that the application would also serve a secondary purpose as a clothing manager,
                        where the user would be able to see which clothes need to be washed, which clothes are currently
                        washing and which clothes are available for selection.

                The process is really simple. When you first create your account, you must first add your clothing to our database.<br>
                After that, you can use our AI to generate you outfits!<br>
                The more clothing you add, the more choices the AI has to go through, giving you a lot more outfit choices.<br>
                No longer have that piece of clothing? No problem! Just simply remove it on the website, and we will stop recommending it.
