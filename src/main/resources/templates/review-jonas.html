                        I always loved supporting and keeping up to date with new technologies.
                        Outfitly was something that immediately caught my attention.
                        I’m a very busy person and don’t always have the time to do all my morning chores before having to leave.
                        Outfitly has saved some of that precious little time I have in the morning.
                        A nice addition to the application is viewing the weather forecast as well so I know what weather I’m facing when going outside.
                        It’s really convenient not only as a clothing picker but it also helps you by being a manager for all your clothes!
