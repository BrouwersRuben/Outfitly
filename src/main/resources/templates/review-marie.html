                        Outfitly was exactly what I was looking for.
                        Having just graduated from university and getting into the working world is as stressful as it gets
                        and picking out clothing for the day has always been a challenge for me.
                        Iâ€™m not that much into fashion but for my job I have to look presentable!
                        But most importantly I just want to feel comfortable. How often I forget to look at the weather forecast to then have the completely wrong outfit!
                        Outfitly does this complete process for you with a click of a button, saving you from a potentially awkward situation.
                        Now picking clothes in the morning takes only a few seconds, and I never feel too cold or too warm.
