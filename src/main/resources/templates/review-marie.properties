review-marie-paragraph = Outfitly was exactly what I was looking for. Having just graduated from university and getting into the working world is as stressful as it gets and picking out clothing for the day has always been a challenge for me. I?m not that much into fashion but for my job I have to look presentable! But most importantly I just want to feel comfortable. How often I forget to look at the weather forecast to then have the completely wrong outfit! Outfitly does this complete process for you with a click of a button, saving you from a potentially awkward situation. Now picking clothes in the morning takes only a few seconds, and I never feel too cold or too warm.
