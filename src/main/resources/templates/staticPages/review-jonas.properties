review-jonas.paragraph = I always loved supporting and keeping up to date with new technologies. Outfitly was something that immediately caught my attention. I'm a very busy person and don't always have the time to do all my morning chores before having to leave. Outfitly has saved some of that precious little time I have in the morning. A nice addition to the application is viewing the weather forecast as well so I know what weather I'm facing when going outside. It's really convenient not only as a clothing picker but it also helps you by being a manager for all your clothes!
